# Robot Vacuum

Robot vacuums are exposed as Matter **Robotic Vacuum Cleaner** devices with the following capabilities:

- **On/Off** - Start and stop cleaning
- **RVC Operational State** - Current state (idle, running, docked, error)
- **RVC Run Mode** - Cleaning modes including room-specific cleaning
- **Service Area** - Room selection for Apple Home (Matter 1.4), with multi-floor map support
- **RVC Clean Mode** - Cleaning type selection (Sweeping, Mopping, etc.) with fan speed and mop intensity
- **Power Source** - Battery level and charging state (if available)
- **Identify** - "Play Sound" in Apple Home triggers `vacuum.locate` to find your robot (v2.0.27+)

## Server Mode (Required for Apple Home & Alexa)

:::{important}
**Apple Home and Alexa do not properly support bridged robot vacuums.** They require the vacuum to appear as a **standalone Matter device**, not as part of a bridge.

If your vacuum shows "Updating" in Apple Home, doesn't respond to Siri commands, or isn't discovered by Alexa, you **must** use **Server Mode**.
:::

### What is Server Mode?

Server Mode exposes a single device as a **standalone Matter device** instead of a bridged device. This is required because:

- Apple Home doesn't support Siri voice commands for bridged RVCs
- Alexa doesn't discover bridged RVCs at all
- The vacuum shows "Updating" or "Not Responding" in Apple Home

### How to Enable Server Mode

1. **Create a new bridge** in the Matter Hub web interface
2. **Enable "Server Mode"** checkbox in the bridge creation wizard
3. Add **only your vacuum** to this bridge (Server Mode supports exactly 1 device)
4. **Pair the new bridge** with Apple Home or Alexa
5. Your other devices stay on your regular bridge(s)

:::{note}
Server Mode bridges can only contain **one device**. This is a Matter protocol requirement for standalone devices.
:::

### After Enabling Server Mode

- Your vacuum will appear as a native Matter device (not bridged)
- Siri voice commands like "Hey Siri, start the vacuum" will work
- Alexa will discover and control the vacuum
- Room selection via Service Area will work in Apple Home

---

## Cleaning Modes

The RVC Clean Mode cluster allows selecting the cleaning type. This is auto-enabled for Dreame and Ecovacs vacuums, and can be manually configured for other brands (including Roborock).

### Supported Cleaning Modes

| Mode | Matter Tag | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Vacuum | Vacuum | Dry vacuum only |
| Mop | Mop | Wet mop only |
| Vacuum & Mop | Vacuum + Mop | Vacuum and mop simultaneously |
| Vacuum Then Mop | DeepClean + Vacuum + Mop | Vacuum first, then mop (Apple Home shows as "Deep Clean") |

:::{note}
**Fallback behavior (v2.0.26+):** If your cleaning mode entity doesn't have a dedicated "Vacuum Then Mop" option, HAMH automatically falls back to the "Vacuum & Mop" option. This means you only need `vacuum`, `mop`, and `vacuum_and_mop` in your cleaning mode entity.
:::

### Auto-Detection (Dreame, Ecovacs)

For Dreame vacuums, the cleaning mode entity is automatically derived from the vacuum entity ID:
- `vacuum.r2d2` → `select.r2d2_cleaning_mode`

For Ecovacs, cleaning mode entities are auto-detected by naming pattern (`*cleaning_mode*`).

No manual configuration is needed unless the entity naming differs.

### Manual Configuration (Ecovacs, Roborock, Others)

For vacuums where the cleaning mode entity can't be auto-detected, you need to configure it manually:

1. Go to your **bridge settings** → **Entity Mappings**
2. **Edit your vacuum entity** (e.g., `vacuum.t20_omni`)
3. Set **Cleaning Mode Entity** to the select entity that controls the cleaning mode
4. Changes take effect automatically within ~30 seconds

:::{tip}
To find the correct select entity, look in Home Assistant for a `select.*` entity belonging to your vacuum device that has options like "Vacuum", "Mop", "Vacuum and mop", etc. The naming varies by brand and language.
:::

### Creating a Cleaning Mode Helper (Roborock & Others)

Some integrations (notably the official Roborock integration) **do not expose a cleaning mode select entity**. Without one, HAMH cannot switch between vacuum, mop, and vacuum+mop modes.

You can create one yourself using Home Assistant helpers and automations:

#### Step 1: Create an Input Select Helper

Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers → Create Helper → Dropdown** and create:

- **Name:** Roborock Cleaning Mode Store
- **Entity ID:** `input_select.roborock_cleaning_mode_store`
- **Options:** `vacuum`, `mop`, `vacuum_and_mop`

#### Step 2: Create a Template Select Entity

Add this to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` (or a separate template file):

```yaml
template:
  - select:
      - name: "Roborock Cleaning Mode"
        unique_id: roborock_cleaning_mode_hamh
        icon: mdi:robot-vacuum
        state: "{{ states('input_select.roborock_cleaning_mode_store') }}"
        availability: >
          {{ states('input_select.roborock_cleaning_mode_store') not in ['unknown','unavailable'] }}
        options: >
          {{ ['vacuum', 'mop', 'vacuum_and_mop'] }}
        select_option:
          - service: input_select.select_option
            target:
              entity_id: input_select.roborock_cleaning_mode_store
            data:
              option: "{{ option }}"
```

#### Step 3: Create an Automation to Apply Settings

This automation watches your cleaning mode store and applies the correct fan speed and mop intensity settings when the mode changes:

```yaml
alias: "Roborock - Apply Cleaning Mode"
triggers:
  - entity_id: input_select.roborock_cleaning_mode_store
    trigger: state
actions:
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: input_select.roborock_cleaning_mode_store
            state: vacuum
        sequence:
          - action: vacuum.set_fan_speed
            target:
              entity_id: vacuum.roborock_s7_maxv
            data:
              fan_speed: balanced
          - action: select.select_option
            target:
              entity_id: select.roborock_s7_maxv_mop_intensity
            data:
              option: "off"
      - conditions:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: input_select.roborock_cleaning_mode_store
            state: mop
        sequence:
          - action: vacuum.set_fan_speed
            target:
              entity_id: vacuum.roborock_s7_maxv
            data:
              fan_speed: "off"
          - action: select.select_option
            target:
              entity_id: select.roborock_s7_maxv_mop_intensity
            data:
              option: mild
      - conditions:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: input_select.roborock_cleaning_mode_store
            state: vacuum_and_mop
        sequence:
          - action: vacuum.set_fan_speed
            target:
              entity_id: vacuum.roborock_s7_maxv
            data:
              fan_speed: balanced
          - action: select.select_option
            target:
              entity_id: select.roborock_s7_maxv_mop_intensity
            data:
              option: mild
```

:::{note}
Replace `vacuum.roborock_s7_maxv` and `select.roborock_s7_maxv_mop_intensity` with your actual entity IDs. Adjust the fan speed and mop intensity values to match your vacuum's available options.
:::

#### Step 4: Configure in HAMH

1. Go to **Entity Mappings** → Edit your vacuum
2. Set **Cleaning Mode Entity** to `select.roborock_cleaning_mode_hamh` (the template select)
3. Set **Mop Intensity Entity** to `select.roborock_s7_maxv_mop_intensity`

After this setup, Apple Home will show Vacuum, Mop, Vacuum & Mop, and Deep Clean (Vacuum Then Mop) as cleaning modes. The automation will apply the correct settings when you switch modes.

## Suction Level / Fan Speed (Apple Home Intensity Options)

When your vacuum has fan speed options, HAMH creates extra intensity modes that Apple Home shows as selectable options under the Vacuum cleaning type.

### Auto-Detection

Fan speed support is **automatically detected** from the vacuum's `fan_speed_list` attribute. No manual configuration is needed.

### Apple Home Display Limitations

Apple Home only supports **3 intensity buckets** for RVC cleaning modes: **Quiet**, **Automatic**, and **Max**. HAMH creates modes for all your fan speeds but Apple Home renders only one option per intensity tag:

| Your Fan Speed | Apple Home Label | Matter Tag |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| quiet, silent, gentle | Quiet | Quiet |
| balanced, standard, normal, auto | Automatic | Auto |
| turbo, strong, max | Max | Max |

Fan speeds that don't match any tag pattern (e.g., "off", "custom", "max_plus") are hidden in Apple Home but still functional via other controllers.

### Manual Override (suctionLevelEntity)

If your vacuum uses a separate `select.*` entity for suction control instead of the built-in fan speed, configure `suctionLevelEntity` in the Entity Mapping.

---

## Mop Intensity (Apple Home Intensity Options)

When your vacuum has mop intensity / water level options, HAMH adds mop intensity modes under the Mop cleaning type.

### Auto-Detection

Mop intensity entities are **automatically detected** for Dreame and Ecovacs vacuums. For Roborock, entities matching `*mop_intensity*`, `*mop_pad_humidity*`, `*water_volume*`, or `*water_amount*` are auto-detected.

### Manual Configuration (mopIntensityEntity)

1. Go to **Entity Mappings** → Edit your vacuum
2. Set **Mop Intensity Entity** to the select entity (e.g., `select.roborock_s7_maxv_mop_intensity`)
3. Changes take effect automatically

### Apple Home Intensity Labels

Apple Home shows the same **Quiet / Automatic / Max** labels for mop intensity as it does for fan speed — this is an Apple limitation. The labels come from Matter mode tags, not from HAMH. Behind the scenes, the routing is correct:

| Apple Home Label | Mop Intensity Action |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Quiet | Sets mop to lowest intensity (e.g., "mild", "low") |
| Automatic | Sets mop to medium intensity (e.g., "moderate", "medium") |
| Max | Sets mop to highest intensity (e.g., "intense", "high") |

:::{important}
**Mop intensity requires a cleaning mode entity.** Without a cleaning mode entity configured, HAMH cannot determine when the vacuum is in Mop mode, and mop intensity options will not appear in Apple Home. See [Creating a Cleaning Mode Helper](#creating-a-cleaning-mode-helper-roborock--others) above if your integration doesn't provide one natively.
:::

### Matter Spec Limitation: Vacuum & Mop Mode

The Matter spec only allows a single `currentMode` value. When in "Vacuum & Mop" mode, HAMH cannot express both fan speed AND mop intensity simultaneously. The base mode is reported without intensity information.

---

## Room Selection

Room selection is supported through multiple mechanisms, with automatic priority:

### 1. Home Assistant Area Mapping (HA 2026.3+) — Recommended

Starting with Home Assistant 2026.3, vacuums that support the **Clean Area** feature can map their internal segments to your existing HA areas. When this mapping is configured in HA, HAMH automatically uses `vacuum.clean_area` for room cleaning — no vendor-specific configuration needed.

**How it works:**
1. Your vacuum integration reports support for `CLEAN_AREA` (supported_features flag `16384`)
2. You map vacuum segments to HA areas in **Settings → Devices → [Your Vacuum] → Configure**
3. HAMH automatically detects the mapping and creates Matter Service Areas from your HA areas
4. Room cleaning uses the standard `vacuum.clean_area` action instead of vendor-specific commands

This is the **preferred method** when available, as it works with any vacuum integration that supports `CLEAN_AREA` (currently Ecovacs, Roborock, and Matter-based vacuums in HA 2026.3+).

:::{note}
When `CLEAN_AREA` mapping is detected, it takes priority over all vendor-specific room detection methods (Valetudo segments, Roborock `get_maps`, Dreame rooms, etc.). The vendor-specific methods remain as fallback for vacuums without `CLEAN_AREA` support.
:::

### 2. Service Area Cluster (Apple Home)

Apple Home uses the Matter 1.4 **Service Area** cluster for room selection. This is automatically enabled when your vacuum exposes room data (via Clean Area mapping, vendor attributes, or manual configuration). Requires **Server Mode**.

### 3. RVC Run Mode (Google Home, Alexa, etc.)

Custom cleaning modes are created for each room, e.g., "Clean Kitchen", "Clean Living Room". These appear as selectable modes in compatible controllers.

### Room Data Requirements (Vendor-Specific Fallback)

When `CLEAN_AREA` is not available, room selection falls back to vendor-specific room data from entity attributes. Supported formats:

```yaml
# Format 1: Direct object (Roborock)
rooms:
  "16": "Kitchen"
  "17": "Living Room"

# Format 2: Segments array
segments:
  - id: 1
    name: Kitchen
  - id: 2
    name: Living Room

# Format 3: Dreame nested format
rooms:
  "My Home":
    - id: 1
      name: Kitchen
    - id: 2
      name: Living Room
```

## Supported Integrations

| Integration | Rooms | Cleaning Modes | Mop Intensity | Notes |
|-------------|-------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Roborock (Official)** | Auto via CLEAN_AREA (HA 2026.3+) or `roborock.get_maps` | Via helper (see above) | `select.*_mop_intensity` | CLEAN_AREA preferred when configured |
| **Roborock (Xiaomi Miot)** | `rooms` or `segments` attribute | — | — | Native room support |
| **Dreame** | `rooms` attribute | Auto-detected | Auto-detected | Full auto-detection |
| **Ecovacs** | Auto via CLEAN_AREA (HA 2026.3+) or `rooms` attribute | Via `cleaningModeEntity` | Auto-detected | CLEAN_AREA preferred when configured |
| **Valetudo** | `segments` attribute | Auto-detected | — | Native support since v2.0.27 via `mqtt.publish` segment_cleanup ([#205](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/205)) |
| **Xiaomi** | `rooms` attribute | — | — | May require custom integration |
| **iRobot Roomba** | — | — | — | Basic start/stop, use `batteryEntity` mapping |

### Roborock (Official Integration)

Since v2.0.25, HAMH **automatically detects Roborock rooms** via the `roborock.get_maps` service call. No manual button entity mapping is needed.

The startup log will show: `Auto-detected X Roborock rooms`

**What's NOT auto-detected:** The Roborock integration does not expose a cleaning mode entity. If you want vacuum/mop/vacuum+mop mode switching, create a helper entity as described in [Creating a Cleaning Mode Helper](#creating-a-cleaning-mode-helper-roborock--others).

#### Fallback: Manual Button Entity Mapping

If auto-detection doesn't work (e.g., older Roborock firmware), you can use button entities:

1. Open **Entity Mappings** → Edit your vacuum
2. In **Room Button Entities**, select the button entities for each room
3. The UI auto-discovers button entities from the same device

:::{tip}
You can also create **multi-room scenes** in the Roborock app and map those button entities for combined room cleaning.
:::

---

## Entity Mapping Reference

| Option | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `cleaningModeEntity` | Select entity for vacuum/mop/vacuum+mop switching | Always, if you want cleaning mode control |
| `suctionLevelEntity` | Select entity for suction / fan speed | Only if vacuum doesn't expose `fan_speed_list` |
| `mopIntensityEntity` | Select entity for mop intensity / water level | When mop control is desired |
| `batteryEntity` | Sensor entity for battery level | Auto-detected; override if auto-detection fails |
| `roomEntities` | Array of button entity IDs for room cleaning | Only if `roborock.get_maps` and room attributes fail |
| `customServiceAreas` | Custom room/zone definitions for generic robots | When your vacuum has no native room support ([#177](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/177)) |

---

## Valetudo Support

Since v2.0.27, HAMH has **native Valetudo support**. Valetudo-based vacuums (Dreame, Roborock via Valetudo) are auto-detected and room cleaning uses `mqtt.publish` with `segment_cleanup` instead of `vacuum.send_command`.

### How It Works

1. HAMH detects Valetudo select entities (e.g., `select.*_fan_speed`, `select.*_water_grade`) automatically
2. Room segments are read from the vacuum entity's `segments` attribute
3. Room cleaning commands are sent via `mqtt.publish` to avoid HA entity targeting issues
4. No manual configuration needed — just add your Valetudo vacuum to a Server Mode bridge

### Requirements

- Valetudo firmware with MQTT autodiscovery enabled
- Home Assistant MQTT integration configured
- Vacuum entity exposes `segments` attribute with room data

---

## Custom Service Areas

Since v2.0.27, you can define **custom room/zone names** for generic zone-based robots that don't expose native room data. This is useful for vacuums controlled via IR remotes, generic Tuya integrations, or any robot where HAMH can't auto-detect rooms.

Configure `customServiceAreas` in the Entity Mapping for your vacuum. Each entry defines a room name and the service call to trigger cleaning for that zone.

See [#177](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/177) for details.

---

## Identify / Locate

Since v2.0.27, the **Identify** cluster is mapped to `vacuum.locate`. When you use "Play Sound" or "Find My" in Apple Home, the vacuum will play its locate sound.

This works regardless of the `vacuumMinimalClusters` feature flag.

---

## Charging State

Since v2.0.27, HAMH reports the `IsCharging` state when the vacuum is docked and charging. Apple Home shows the correct charging indicator. When the battery reaches 100% while docked, `IsAtFullCharge` is also reported.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Vacuum not showing in Apple Home

1. **Use Server Mode** — bridged vacuums don't work in Apple Home. Create a dedicated Server Mode bridge.
2. **Update all Home Hubs** — All HomePods and Apple TVs must be on iOS/tvOS/AudioOS 18.4+
3. **Re-pair** — Remove from Apple Home and add again after enabling Server Mode

### Rooms not appearing in Apple Home

1. **Check Server Mode** — Room selection requires Server Mode
2. **Re-pair the vacuum** — Remove from Apple Home and add again after updating HAMH
3. **Check logs** — Look for `Auto-detected X Roborock rooms` or `Resolved X rooms` in the startup log
4. **Verify room data** — Check your vacuum entity attributes for `rooms`, `segments`, or `room_list`

### Room selection not working

1. Check the logs for errors when selecting a room
2. Verify the vacuum integration supports `vacuum.send_command` with `app_segment_clean`
3. For Roborock: rooms are triggered via the Roborock cloud, ensure cloud connectivity

### Mop intensity not showing in Apple Home

1. **Configure a cleaning mode entity** — Mop intensity requires one. See [Creating a Cleaning Mode Helper](#creating-a-cleaning-mode-helper-roborock--others)
2. **Configure mop intensity entity** — Set `mopIntensityEntity` in Entity Mapping
3. **Re-pair** — New clusters require a fresh pairing

### Apple Home shows "Updating..." or "No Response"

1. **Check Server Mode** — Must be enabled for Apple Home
2. **Check network** — See [Connectivity Issues](../Guides/Connectivity%20Issues.md)
3. **Check logs** — Look for errors related to battery, cluster creation, or Matter.js
4. **Factory reset** — As a last resort, factory reset the bridge and re-pair

### "Deep Clean" mode doesn't work

Since v2.0.26, "Vacuum Then Mop" (shown as "Deep Clean" in Apple Home) falls back to "Vacuum & Mop" when your cleaning mode entity doesn't have a dedicated option. If it still fails, check that your cleaning mode entity includes `vacuum_and_mop` as an option.

### Intensity options look the same for Vacuum and Mop mode

This is an Apple Home limitation. Apple renders the same labels (Quiet / Automatic / Max) for both vacuum fan speed and mop intensity because both use the same Matter mode tags. The routing behind the labels is correct — selecting "Quiet" in Mop mode sets mop intensity, while "Quiet" in Vacuum mode sets fan speed.
